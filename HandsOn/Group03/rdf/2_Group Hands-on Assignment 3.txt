Group Hands-on Assignment 3

The goal of this assignment is to get familiar with the transformation of CSV data into RDF using LODRefine.

The students will have to take their selected dataset(s) and perform the following tasks:

Import data. Import data into LODRefine.
Analyse and fix data. The analysis was performed in the previous class, but it can be updated with new findings. Fix the data in order to remove errors and transform them in order to facilitate the process of generating RDF from them.
Export to RDF. Define an RDF skeleton for the data and export it to RDF (using the Turtle syntax).
Assignment materials

This assignment has to be performed with the datasets selected by each group of students.

Deliverables

The deliverables must be uploaded to the hands-on group directory in github (i.e., "/HandsOn/GroupXX/").

The deliverables required for this assignment are:

A JSON file with the operations performed over the data for fixing and transforming them (“*.json” under a “lodrefine” directory).

An RDF file in the Turtle syntax with the data transformed into RDF (“*.rdf” under an “rdf” directory).
